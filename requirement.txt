A weather application that provides detailed weather details for a location specified by the user.

Built using React and Open Weather API for showing latest weather data. Here we have search options with city and country for which we would like to see weather forecast.

We will use the fetch method to fetch the API calls along with the React hooks and conditional rendering.
